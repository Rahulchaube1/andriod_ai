# Chatbot AI Project

Welcome to the Chatbot AI Project! This repository contains a chatbot similar to ChatGPT, developed using modern AI techniques. The chatbot can handle various types of conversational inputs and provide intelligent responses.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to understand user input.
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains context in conversations to provide relevant responses.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable parameters for different use cases.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Handles extended conversations with multiple exchanges.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python (or specify the language you used)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: 
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model training)
  - Hugging Face Transformers (for pre-trained models and tokenization)
  - Flask/Django (for the web interface, if applicable)
- **Data Sources**: Describe any datasets used or specify if you used publicly available datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chatbot AI Project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
